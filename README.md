Short-term sentiment indicators
Short-term sentiment indicators are tools used to measure the overall attitude of investors toward a particular security or financial market over a short period of time, typically less than a month. They are used to gauge how optimistic or pessimistic people are about the current market or economic conditions soon.
There are many different types of short-term sentiment indicators, but some of the most common include:

•	**Investor surveys:** These surveys ask investors about their current investment positions and their outlook for the next few weeks or months.

•	**Media sentiment:** This measures the tone of news articles and other media coverage of a particular security or market over the past few weeks or months.

•	**Social media sentiment:** This measures the sentiment expressed on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook over the past few weeks or months.

•	**Trading volume:** This measures the number of shares traded in a particular security or market over the past few weeks or months.

•	**Put/call ratio:** This measures the number of put options (which bet on a decline in the price of a security) to call options (which bet on an increase in the price of a security) over the past few weeks or months.

**Short-term sentiment indicators** can be used to help investors make better investment decisions. For example, if sentiment indicators are showing that investors are becoming more bullish, it may be a good time to buy stocks. Conversely, if sentiment indicators are showing that investors are becoming more bearish, it may be a good time to sell stocks.

However, it is important to remember that sentiment indicators are not always accurate. They can be influenced by several factors, including news events, economic data, and investor psychology. As a result, it is important to use sentiment indicators in conjunction with other factors when making investment decisions.

•	**Social media sentiment:** Social media sentiment is a newer way to measure sentiment because it gauges how people are talking about the market on social media platforms. There are many different ways to measure social media sentiment,**but some of the most popular include the Brandwatch Consumer Research Suite and the SentiOne Social Media Analytics Platform.

•	**Trading volume:** Trading volume is a measure of how much trading is taking place in a particular security or market. High trading volume can be a sign of strong investor interest, while low trading volume can be a sign of weak investor interest.

•	**Put/call ratio:** The put/call ratio is a measure of the number of put options (which bet on a decline in the price of a security) to call options (which bet on an increase in the price of a security). A high put/call ratio can be a sign of bearish sentiment, while a low put/call ratio can be a sign of bullish sentiment.
